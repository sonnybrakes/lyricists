# Going My Own Way
## (working title)
### Written by, Lucid D.

    Yesterday morning
    I was easing on down the road
    Dreaming of satisfaction
    That would turn my life to gold

    Empty pockets
    Fond memories
    Burned out rockets, and
    Long wet dreams, left me

    Easy money
    Should a called it a hard buck
    Don't tease me, honey
    Cause I'm down on my luck
    Times could be better
    Lord, I'm not one to complain
    I do my part, and
    I'll do it again

    That's why i'm working
    why i'm hoping
    why I'm... living for some day
    I'm still dreaming
    I'm still hoping
    Hoping for the day
    I could live my life my way
    No one tell me what to say, and
    I take it day by day

    Gonna live my life, my way, ah yeah
    ah ummmm... ah yeah, gonna go, gonna go my own way
    hmmmm... yeah, wanna go, gonna, gonna go my own way
    ummmm hmmmm

    Easy money
    Should a called it a hard buck
    Don't tease me, honey
    Cause I'm down on my luck
    Times could be better
    Lord, I'm not one to complain
    I do my part, and
    I'll do it again
    Yes, I'll do it again

    That's why I'm still working,
    I'm still paying
    Paying for Yesterday

    I'm still dreaming
    I'm still hoping
    I'm still living for some day
    Could live my life my way
    No one tell me what to say
    No, I'm going to go my own way
    I'm gonna take it day by day
    Gonna go my own way
