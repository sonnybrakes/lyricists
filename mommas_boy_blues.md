# Momma's boy blues
## Time Signature: 4/4

    Momma have you seen papa
    No, no son he is still at the bar
    He has been drinking and thinking for so long
    Oh son don't you do what he's done
    you won't get very far
    You must follow that rainbow
    you got to walk in that sunshine
    But til that time my little boy
    just put your hand in mine
    The whippoorwill is singing
    such a sad and lonesome song
    And my old man keeps playing
    with a bottle all day long
    Momma don't you cry
    Momma don't you cry no more
    Momma don't you sigh through that door
    because your little boy is grown up for sure
    We will follow that rainbow
    We will walk in that sunshine.
    From now on, momma
    Just put your little hand in mine
